# Cryptocurrencies
Module 18 - Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Purpose:

My goal is to find common groupings of currently traded cryptocurrencies. 

## Method:

To analyze the dataset, the data will need to be prepped to run through the PCA algorithms. I will use the PCA to reduce the number of dimensions and KMeans to determine the number of clusters to break the data into.


## Results:

The data was grouped into 4 clusters based on 3 summarized dimensions.
